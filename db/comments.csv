25,Iurii,"UBB eliminates or minimizes the negative impact of factors that deplete the immune system of bees and cause of death, especially in the most difficult winter period. Excellent protection against cold, noise, vibrations, oscillations of the magnetic field, excessive moisture, pests, birds, extreme outdoor temperature, sunlight and wind provide bees opportunity to be in deep dormancy (hibernation, calm) throughout the winter, while consuming a minimum amount of food. UBB also creates optimal conditions for spring development of bee colonies and prevents the brood from hypothermia and helps  defeating infectious diseases. Thus UBB contributes to survival bee colony even in those circumstances, where traditional methods do not work.",2,2017-05-14 07:42:27.979429,2017-05-14 07:42:28.133026,ukrainianbeehive@gmail.com
26,Iurii,"UBB is designed for maximum satisfaction of the needs of bees. But at the same time it is very convenient and technological for the beekeeper. In UBB used standard Langstroth frame and maintenance do not need any special equipment.
The main disadvantage of UBB is that large honey supers are twice as  heavy as conventional hives. Such supers could be removed and carried by two people. With a small number of hives honey harvesting could be done by taking frames separately. 
Also, UBB can not guarantee the safety against bee poisoning, poor diet or infectious diseases and parasites.",3,2017-05-14 07:44:01.950240,2017-05-14 07:44:02.125715,ukrainianbeehive@gmail.com
27,Iurii,"By keeping bees in UBB, virtually all known methods could be used to combat the varroa mite. Through improved access to the brood chambers, the procedure of cutting out drone brood from the frame and installation of medications directly into the bee nest is greatly simplified.
Availability of bottom with mesh opening, what easily can be opened (closed), makes it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of anti-mite medications, especially when using substances that evaporate easily.",11,2017-05-14 07:48:09.142812,2017-05-14 07:48:09.329897,ukrainianbeehive@gmail.com
